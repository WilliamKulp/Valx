The study partner must be familiar with overall function and behavior, such as day-to-day activities and cognitive abilities. A second study partner may serve as backup. The study partner must be available to conduct the functional scales as described in the SoA. If a study partner must withdraw from study participation, a replacement may be allowed at the investigator’s discretion. The replacement will need to sign a separate informed consent on the first visit that he or she accompanies the participant.
5. Have adequate literacy, vision, and hearing for neuropsychological testing in the opinion of the investigator at the time of screening.

15. Have a centrally read MRI demonstrating presence of ARIA-E, >4 cerebral microhemorrhages, more than 1 area of superficial siderosis, any macrohemorrhage or severe white matter disease at screening.
16. ALT ≥2.5X ULN of the performing laboratory, AST ≥2.5X ULN, TBL ≥1.5X ULN, or ALP ≥2X ULN at screening.
